                            <p className='py-2'>Dr. Obadina has received much international attention for his research into the nutritional properties of millet snacks. For this project, he assessed millet products and in doing so determined that they serve as an effective substitute for wheat flour. His research has shown that millet flour is categorically more nutritious than wheat flour and is suitable for the production of healthy snacks and bread. This research is especially important today, as recent research continues to reveal the adverse effects gluten has on one’s health. Dr. Obadina’s work highlights millet as a gluten-free alternative to biscuits, cookies, cakes, and other products that traditionally utilize wheat flour.

                            <p className='py-2'>Dr. Obadina evaluated the safety and quality of Nigerian maize. While assessing a selection of 70 composite maize samples, he found 62 distinct fungal and 4 bacterial metabolites. In particular, he identified the presence of Aflatoxin B1 and Fumonisin B1. He determined that these metabolites were present in 67.1% and 92.9% of samples respectively. In the same project, Dr. Obadina discovered that the quality of the storage structure in which the maize was kept also correlated positively and negatively with grain contamination. These results highlight the widespread contamination of Nigerian maize grains and inspire the establishment of policies for reducing mycotoxin contamination. Dr. Folarin Oguntoyinbo has recounted Dr. Obadina’s accomplishments in a supporting letter.

                                Dr. Obadina has described his findings related to the safety and quality of Nigerian maize in “Fungal and bacterial metabolites of stored maize (Zea mays, L.) from five agro-ecological zones of Nigeria,” which was published in Mycotoxin Research in 2014. This paper has garnered 115 citations to date, placing it in the top 10% of papers published in the field of Agricultural Sciences for its year.
                                Dr. Obadina’s successful publication of his work demonstrates its value in the field. Dr. Obadina’s peers have been significantly influenced in their own work by his prior findings regarding the safety and quality of Nigerian maize.

                            <p className='py-2'>Dr. Obadina has also worked to evaluate food safety knowledge in developing countries. To begin this project, he surveyed people in African and Asian countries in order to gain insight into their knowledge and general attitude toward food safety. These surveys yielded a number of notable findings. For example, Dr. Obadina ascertained that respondents from Cameroon on average possessed less knowledge of food safety than respondents from Ghana and Nigeria. Furthermore, the results of this survey also brought him to the conclusion that respondents from Iran possessed less food safety knowledge than respondents from Malaysia and Pakistan, and that 67.1% of respondents mentioned eating food that had been stored at room temperature. These findings are useful for identifying regions in which food safety knowledge is less common and helps guide the effort to promote sustainable, healthy food production and consumption on an international level. Dr. Obadina’s research has been described in more detail by Dr. Folarin Oguntoyinbo.

                            <p className='py-2'>Dr. Obadina has conducted research on food system transformation and its influence on the safety of Nigerian foods. In this project, Dr. Obadina examined the effects of various practices on the chemical, microbiological, and physical features of Nigerian agricultural products. For example, during one stage of this project, he evaluated the impact of lactic acid fermentation on mycotoxin contamination. This research informs future efforts to reduce contaminants and prompt the resilience of food value chains. Dr. Saweda Onipede Liverpool-Tasie has provided further detail regarding this research project.
